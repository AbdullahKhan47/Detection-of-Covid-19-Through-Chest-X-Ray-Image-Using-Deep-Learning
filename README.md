# Detection-of-Covid-19-Through-Chest-X-Ray-Image-Using-Deep-Learning

# Details
This project is build by myself in python using deep Learning and CNN concepts. It accepts Chest X-ray image from the user and differentiate wether the patient has Covid-19 OR Not.The backend is made by using tensroflow and keras.

The CNN model has a accuracy of 98%. The data figures are Covid-19 images=2600 and Normal images=6200.
